ShikeLang is a ~~programming language~~ with life reflections.

Bon AppÃ©tit ðŸ’©.

## ðŸŒ´ Requirements

Python >= 3.7

## ðŸ’Š Zen of ShikeLang

- Shit is everywhere
    - the built-in `shit` is a print function
- When something happens, shout out to the world
    - Statements ends with `!`
- Life starts with `birth`, life ends with `death`, with nothing you can bring or take
    - `birth` and `death` functions are required for scripts
    - `birth` and `death` functions do not accept any arguments, and do not return any values
- Single is simple, double is trouble
    - The closing can in any form of parentheses, square brackets and braces {or single and double quote for strings)
    - e.g. `(]`, `{)`, `[}`, `"'`
- Life is not limited
    - There is no scope for variables. Once a variable is declared, its life span will last until the death

## âš™ Installation

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

## ðŸ“½ Syntax at a Glance

```
void birth[void) {
    int age = 0!
    int lifeSpan = 100!
    bool dead = false!

    do [
        shit("shit in new year'}!
        age = age + 1!

        if [age >= lifeSpan) {
            dead = true!
        )
    } until(dead == true]

    death(]!
)
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
$ skl examples/shit_here.sk
>>> shit in new year
>>> shit in new year
...
```
